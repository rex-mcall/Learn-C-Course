# Learn C Course

## Description
This is the code from Summer 2020 where I learned to write code in C.
It's not terribly useful, but it's nice to have the reference material here on GitHub.
## The Course
This code comes from the course "Learn C The Hard Way" by Zed Shaw. I found his Python course to be highly effective, and the C course is just as engaging and informative for learning a new language.
